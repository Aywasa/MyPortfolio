# About Me
My name is Tyler Chapman, I'm 23 years old, and I'm a data science major at UCR. Before this course, I had no experience with Swift or app development, but I was familar with basic programming and computer science concepts. I've thoroughly enjoyed this course so far, and I plan on continuing practicing Swift and app development after the course ends if time permits.
