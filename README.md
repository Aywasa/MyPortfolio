# About Me
My name is Tyler Chapman, I'm 23 years old, and I'm a data science major at UCR. Before this course, I had no experience with Swift or app development, but I was familar with basic programming and computer science concepts. I've thoroughly enjoyed this course so far, and I plan on continuing practicing Swift and app development after the course ends if time permits.

# MyPortfolio
Here are examples of projects that I've created.
# [Project 1: Apple Pie](https://github.com/Aywasa/ApplePie.git)
I built a word-guessing game where each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.
